3main edits (by stubo):
Beautify the source code by running it through the python script I tracked down
Removed the infinite loops and put one at the end to cover all mining blocks
Removed repetitive if LOCAL then "screen -r miner" from each mining block and put one at the end to cover all mining blocks
Added support for BTG as per forum posts
Changed ZM lines to use the latest ZM miner 0.5.5 (s/5_3/5_4/g)
Added telemetry/api to EWBF and ZM miner launches so that you can hit <host>:42000 to see this miner output
Added the ability to pass in a miner password for all miners that have the "--pass" arg. 
Changed instances of "--pass x" and "--pass x"  and "-p x" to "--pass $MINER_PWD" 
Note that I left the SALFTER inline stuff alone since I don't know much about it [yet]. 
Also left the instances of "--pass $ZPOOLPASS" alone but it would be nice to consolidate miner password handling.
Changed dstm zm location to "~/zec/zm/latest/" for easier future updates (papampi mod)
Changed all miner start scripts to use separate pool and port from 1bash so watchdog can check the pool connection easier (papampi mod)
Added log rotate settings (papampi mod)
