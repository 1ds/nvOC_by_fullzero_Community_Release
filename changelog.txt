  3main edits :
  Beautify the source code by running it through the python script I tracked down (stubo)
  Removed the infinite loops and put one at the end to cover all mining blocks (stubo)
  Removed repetitive if LOCAL then "screen -r miner" from each mining block and put one at the end to cover all mining blocks (stubo)
  Added support for BTG as per forum posts
  Changed ZM lines to use the latest ZM miner 0.5.5 (s/5_3/5_4/g)
  Added telemetry/api to EWBF and ZM miner launches so that you can hit <host>:42000 to see this miner output (stubo)
  Added the ability to pass in a miner password for all miners that have the "--pass" arg. (stubo)
  Changed instances of "--pass x" and "--pass x"  and "-p x" to "--pass $MINER_PWD" (stubo)
  Changed dstm zm location to "~/zec/zm/latest/" for easier future updates (papampi mod)
  Changed all miner start scripts to use separate pool and port from 1bash so watchdog can check the pool connection easier (papampi mod)
  Added log rotate settings (papampi mod)
  Moved miner start from 3main to 0miner, to make 3main lighter and better handle of miner start (papampi) 
  Added auto start miner yes or no ( in case you need to edit or debug the rig) (papampi)
  

  1bash edits:
  Added EWBF_OPTS and ZM_OPTS for telemetry/api to EWBF and ZM miner (Stubu mod)
  Added MINER_PWD for miner passwords (Stubu mod)
  Unified and separated all pool address and pool ports so wdog can check if pool is up or no if needed (papampi mod)
    
  IAmNotAJeep wdog edits:
  Added check if miner is running or not when utilization dropped to restart miner faster (stubo mod)
  Added check for internet and wait if its down before going to restart miner and reboot system (stubo mod)
  Added check mining pool:port if internet is up and wait before going to restart miner or reboot system (papampi mod)
  Added "Warning" to log output of alerts to catch them easier (papampi mod)
  Changed logfile location to tmpfs (papampi mod)
  Changed logging system to only keep last "warnings" with max 2k size.
  Added checking number of gpus installed vs system reported gpus at start of wdog, so you know if a gpu is not working.
  Added dynamic wait time based on gpu count for wdog to start check 

  Temp Control By LEENOOX:
  Set higher process and disk I/O priorities - Temp control is essential service
  Auto detection of number of GPU's
  Only set, adjust and display available GPU's, dynamic variables creation
  Numeric check of the return values from nvidia-smi (looking for numbers only, anything else = error)
  Reboot if GPU error detected and watchdog didn't react for 60 seconds (act as a backup watchdog)
  Added query delay to nvidia API (no burst spamming, added 0.5 sec delay, prevent overload), helps reduce stale shares
  New (improved) display output including colors and bold text
  Fixed the log file handling (Bug fix: Previous implemantation was not limiting the file size)
  Removed repetitive GPUFanControlState setting, it only needs to be set once, not every cycle (prevent API overload)
 
  Other fix and edits
  Added log rotation (papampi mod)
  changed minerinfo and papampi-telegram for new log locations (papampi mod)
  Create tmpfs partition to change logfile location to tmpfs to lower read/writes to HDD/USB (papampi mod)
  changed minerinfo web so those who dont use wtm dont see empty or no wtm entries
    
  And so many more
  
  Keep calm and carry on mining ...
